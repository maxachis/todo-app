rules:
  proposal:
    - Reference existing FR/NFR IDs when the change modifies existing behavior
    - Include a "Non-goals" section for scope clarity
  delta-spec:
    - Use the same numbering scheme as SPECS.md (FR-X.Y, NFR-X, T-M-X, etc.)
    - Specify test IDs for any new or modified behavior
  tasks:
    - Include which files need to change (views, templates, JS, tests)
    - Keep individual tasks small enough to verify independently
