## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Network list and detail views
The system SHALL provide list and detail views for people, organizations, and interactions in the Svelte UI. Each detail view SHALL include a "Linked Tasks" section showing tasks associated with the entity. Entity selection fields in create and edit forms SHALL use typeahead inputs instead of native dropdown selects. Type typeaheads on Organizations and Interactions pages SHALL support inline creation of new types via the TypeaheadSelect `onCreate` callback. The People list view SHALL include a sort control bar between the create form and the list, allowing the user to choose a sort field and toggle sort direction. The People list sort bar SHALL include a "Follow-up status" sort option in addition to the existing name and cadence sort fields. Each person in the People list SHALL display a follow-up status indicator when the person has a follow-up cadence set, showing the days since last interaction and cadence value with color-coded urgency (overdue, due soon, on track). The People detail panel SHALL display the most recent interaction date and type when available. The People detail panel SHALL display an overdue warning when the person is past their follow-up cadence. The People detail panel SHALL include a quick-log interaction form below the last-interaction summary.
