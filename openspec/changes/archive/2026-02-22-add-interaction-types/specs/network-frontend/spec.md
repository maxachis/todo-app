## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Network list and detail views
The system SHALL provide list and detail views for people, organizations, and interactions in the Svelte UI. Each detail view SHALL include a "Linked Tasks" section showing tasks associated with the entity. The Interactions page SHALL include an inline form for creating new interaction types, following the same pattern as org type creation on the Organizations page.

#### Scenario: View person detail with linked tasks

- **THEN** the detail panel shows the person data, related interactions, and a "Linked Tasks" section listing tasks linked to that person

#### Scenario: View organization detail with linked tasks
- **WHEN** a user selects an organization from the list
- **THEN** the detail panel shows the organization data and a "Linked Tasks" section listing tasks linked to that organization

#### Scenario: View interaction detail with linked tasks
- **WHEN** a user selects an interaction from the list
- **THEN** the detail panel shows the interaction data and a "Linked Tasks" section listing tasks linked to that interaction

#### Scenario: Linked tasks section supports add and remove
- **WHEN** a person, organization, or interaction detail view is displayed
- **THEN** the "Linked Tasks" section provides an add button to link new tasks and a remove button on each linked task to unlink it

#### Scenario: Create interaction type inline on Interactions page
- **WHEN** a user enters a type name and submits the type creation form on the Interactions page
- **THEN** the new interaction type is created and appears in the interaction type dropdown
