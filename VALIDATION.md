| When pinning, ensure user doesn't get disoriented because sections move down to accomodate space for new pin. | Added pin/unpin viewport anchoring so the clicked task stays visually stable after HTMX center-panel re-render. | Scroll center panel to middle of a long list, pin a non-visible-top task, and confirm the viewport does not jump to a different region after the swap. Repeat for unpin. | [ ] | Does not currently work. |
| Can edit emoji or title, but then cannot edit either again until after refresh. Fix. | Added `htmx:load` event listener in `app.js` to re-initialize after OOB swaps that destroy the triggering element. | 1. Click the list header to enter edit mode. Change the title and press Enter. 2. Click the header again — it should enter edit mode a second time without refreshing. 3. Click the emoji button, pick an emoji, then click the header again to edit the title — both should work without refresh. 4. Double-click a list name in the sidebar, change it, press Enter. Double-click it again — it should enter edit mode again. | [ ] | |
