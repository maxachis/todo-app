- [ ] Add keyboard commands for:
    - [ ] Tabbing between Navigation (Ctrl + Left/Right Arrows)
- Search — No way to find tasks across lists currently. A search bar in the navbar that filters tasks by         
  title/notes/tags would be very useful.                                                                             - Overdue highlighting — Due dates exist but aren't visually distinguished. Overdue in red, due today in amber,  
  upcoming in the current subtle gray.
- Drag to reorder sections — You can reorder tasks but not sections within a list.
- Task count badges — Show task counts on sidebar list items (e.g., "Groceries (3)") so you can see at a glance  
  where work lives.
- [ ] On timesheet, include the exact time an hour was added
- [ ] Have the week selector start on Sunday and end on Saturday, instead of Monday -> Sunday
- [ ] Eliminate flicker with task checked off
- [ ] Tab should only go one level below, i.e., it shouldn't automatically become the subsubtask of a subtask if it's currently at task level -- it should be the subtask of the parent task of that subtask
- [ ] Be able to delete task using "delete" button.
- [ ] If in "add a task" mode, be able to arrow key up or down to get into the next open task
- [ ] Make tasks/subtasks collapsible, hiding their subtasks (but making it clear how many subtasks there are, when hidden)
- [ ] Enable clicking and dragging task lists
